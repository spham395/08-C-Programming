# MEMORY MANAGEMENT

### Definitions:
* Compile time
    * The moment in which SOURCE CODE is compiled into a binary without being executed.
* Run time
    * The moment in which a BINARY is executed.
* Stack
    * Region of memory in a process's virtual address space where data is added or removed in a **last-in-first-out** manner.
* Heap
    * Region of memory in a process's virtual address space available to allocate blocks of memory in an arbitrary order and accessed multiple times.
* Memory leak
    * A failure in a program to release allocated memory that is no longer needed, causing diminished computer performance or failure.

## CONCEPTS

#### OVERVIEW

Typical C program sections in memory:
1. TEXT segment (low addresses)
2. DATA segment
3. BSS (BLOCK STARTED by SYMBOL) segment
4. HEAP segment
5. STACK segment (high addresses)

NOTE: Different sources enumerate segments differently!!!

1. TEXT SEGMENT
    1. aka the CODE segment.
    2. Contains executable instructions.
    3. Read from program file.
    4. Read only.

2. DATA SEGMENT
    1. aka initialized data
    2. contains global variables and static variables initialized by the programmer.
    3. NOT read only.

3. BSS (BLOCK STARTED by SYMBOL) SEGMENT
    1. Contains global variables and static variables that are initialized to 0 or not initialized at all.
    2. Initialized by the kernel to 0.
    3. NOT read only.

4. HEAP SEGMENT
    1. This is where DYNAMIC MEMORY allocation takes place.
    2. Grows to larger addresses (moves upwards).
    3. Shared by all shared libraries and dynamically loaded modules in a process.
    4. Managed by C standard library functions.
    5. Memory allocated to HERE remains in existence for the duration of the program.

5. STACK SEGMENT
    1. Implemented as a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
    2. A *stack pointer* tracks the top of the stack as it changes.
    3. Grows to smaller addresses (moves downwards).
    4. Automatic variables are stored here.
    5. Function calls results in a *stack frame* being **pushed** onto the stack.

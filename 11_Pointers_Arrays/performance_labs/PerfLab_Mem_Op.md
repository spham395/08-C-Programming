# Performance Lab - Memory Operators
### "Reference Not Found"
* Declare userInput, tempValue, and input_ptr as the same data type
* Read user input into variable userInput
* Ensure tempValue contains the same  value as userInput utilizing one or more memory operators

|tempValue = userInput; // NOT PERMITTED... use a memory operator|
|----------------------------------------------------------------|

* Print the value **and** the pointer for each of the three variables in a human readable format
* Locate those addresses in the "memory window"
* Submitt your work to the appropriate location for instructor review

**Note** "input_ptr" should be a pointer variable

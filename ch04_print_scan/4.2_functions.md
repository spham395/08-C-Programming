# I/O Functions

Believe it or not, this class has already been using standard functions, libraries and headers. Keep in mind, we will continue to travel mostly blind until we reach **Chapter 8: Functions.**

Functions are segments of code that perform a specific task. These tasks can be called and repeated whenever. Functions break large computing tasks into smaller ones. Standard functions are grouped, according to purpose, into libraries \(e.g., C Standard Input and Output Library\). Libraries are referenced through header files \(e.g., stdio.h\). 

## Example Functions

#### Some functions take input, aka arguments

##### -printf\(\)

#### Some functions do not require arguments

##### -getchar\(\)

#### Some functions give output, aka return value

##### -putchar\(\)

#### Some functions have no return value

##### -exit\(\)

## Function Syntax

```c
<return type> <function name> (<arg type> <argument>, ...)
```

### Example 1 - printf\(\)

```c
int printf(const char *format, ...)
```

### Example 2 - getchar\(\)

```c
int getchar(void)
```

### Example 3 - putchar\(\)

```c
int putchar(int c)
```

### Example 4 - exit\(\)

```c
void exit(int status)
```

**NOTE: Some functions have multiple implementations**

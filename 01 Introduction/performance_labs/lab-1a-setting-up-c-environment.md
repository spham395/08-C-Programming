# !!! ATTENTION: THIS LAB IS DEPRECATED !!!
This lab is to only be used if needed. All computers should be sharing the same exact snapshot with all the required tools. 

In this lab, we are going to ensure everything is setup properly and we are going to go over some tools you are free to use.

### IDE/Text Editor:

  * Commonly used IDE
  * I personally don't recommend it
* **Borland \(Windows\)**
  * A bit older
* **Turbo C \(Windows\)**
  * Oldest IDE for C

#### **Compiler**

* **GNU Compiler Collection \(GCC\) - Cross-platform**
  * We will be using this a lot to compile our code
  * **Install instructions below**
* **Clang Compiler**
  * Popular on OSX, though it's contributors include Apple, Microsoft, Google, ARM, etc

  * Installed on every single Linux OS virtually
  * Bit more challenging to use
  * VERY powerful

#### **Tools**

* **CMake**
  * Used to manage the build process of software using compiler-independent methods.

4. If you received the above error, GCC is installed. 
5. type in: **g++**
6. Verify: **g++: fatal error: no input files**
7. If you received the above error, G++ is installed
8. If you did not receive either or both errors, continue to **Check PATH**

**Check Path:**

1. Navigate to Local Disk root
2. If MinGW directory does not exist, jump to **Install MinGW**
3. If it does exist, click the start button and type **path**
4. A selection should appear called: **Edit Environment Variables for your Account**, click it. 
5. Under **User Variables for \[username\]**, 
   1. select **path**
   2. click **edit**
   3. click **new**
   4. input **C:\MinGW\bin**
   5. click **OK**
6. Click **OK** and close all instances of command prompt
7. Attempt **Check if it's already setup **steps again

**Install MinGW**

1. Open your browser and navigate to [https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/Installer/)

   3. Click **Installation **on the top tool bar and select **Apply Changes**
   4. Wait for install to finish and proceed to **Check Path**

## Compiling and Running C Code

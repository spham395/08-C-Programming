# Lab 1A: Declaring Variables

![](/assets/817d317eecb8af559b39be77577c2b2e--engineer-humor-computer-jokes.jpg)

In this lab, you will declare and initialize variables of the following types:

* int
* float
* double
* char

Then print the variables and their sizes, using the previous lab as a reference.  We will discuss printing in later topics.

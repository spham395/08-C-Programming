1. Run program(given by instructor) again, but this time give your first and last name when it asks you for your first name. What happens? Why? (needs revision) 
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>      // for strlen() prototype
#define DENSITY 62.4     // human density in lbs per cu ft
int main()
{
    float weight, volume;
    int size, letters;
    char name[40];        // name is an array of 40 chars

    printf("Hi! What's your first name?\n");
    scanf("%s", name);
    printf("%s, what's your weight in pounds?\n", name);
    scanf("%f", &weight);
    size = sizeof name;
    letters = strlen(name);
    volume = weight / DENSITY;
    printf("Well, %s, your volume is %2.2f cubic feet.\n",
            name, volume);
    printf("Also, your first name has %d letters,\n",
            letters);
    printf("and we have %d bytes to store it.\n", size);

    return 0;
}
```

2. Assuming that each of the following examples is part of a complete program, what will each one print?

a.
```c
printf("He sold the painting for $%2.2f.\n", 2.345e2);
```
b.
```c
printf("%c%c%c\n", 'H', 105, '\41');
```
c.
```c
#define Q "His Hamlet was funny without being vulgar."

   printf("%s\nhas %d characters.\n", Q, strlen(Q));
```
d.
```c
printf("Is %2.2e the same as %2.2f?\n", 1201.0, 1201.0);
```
3. In Question 2c, what changes could you make so that string Q is printed out enclosed in double quotation marks?

4. It’s find the error time!

```c

define B booboo
define X 10
main(int)
{
   int age;
   char name;

   printf("Please enter your first name.");
   scanf("%s", name);
   printf("All right, %c, what's your age?\n", name);
   scanf("%f", age);
   xp = age + X;
   printf("That's a %s! You must be at least %d.\n", B, xp);
   rerun 0;
}
```
5. Suppose a program starts as follows:
```c
#define BOOK "War and Peace"
int main(void)
{
   float cost =12.99;
   float percent = 80.0;
```
Construct a printf() statement that uses BOOK, cost, and percent to print the following:
```c
This copy of "War and Peace" sells for $12.99.
That is 80% of list.
```
6. What conversion specification would you use to print each of the following?

a. A decimal integer with a field width equal to the number of digits

b. A hexadecimal integer in the form 8A in a field width of 4

c. A floating-point number in the form 232.346 with a field width of 10

d. A floating-point number in the form 2.33e+002 with a field width of 12

e. A string left-justified in a field of width 30

7. Which conversion specification would you use to print each of the following?

a. An unsigned long integer in a field width of 15

b. A hexadecimal integer in the form 0x8a in a field width of 4

c. A floating-point number in the form 2.33E+02 that is left-justified in a field width of 12

d. A floating-point number in the form +232.346 in a field width of 10

e. The first eight characters of a string in a field eight characters wide

8. What conversion specification would you use to print each of the following?

a. A decimal integer having a minimum of four digits in a field width of 6

b. An octal integer in a field whose width will be given in the argument list

c. A character in a field width of 2

d. A floating-point number in the form +3.13 in a field width equal to the number of characters in the number

e. The first five characters in a string left-justified in a field of width 7

9. For each of the following input lines, provide a scanf() statement to read it. Also declare any variables or arrays used in the statement.

a. 101

b. 22.32 8.34E−09

c. linguini

d. catch 22

e. catch 22 (but skip over catch)

10. What is whitespace?

11. What’s wrong with the following statement and how can you fix it?
```c

printf("The double type is %z bytes..\n", sizeof (double));
```
12. Suppose that you would rather use parentheses than braces in your programs. How well would the following work?
```c
#define ( {
#define ) }
```

# Stub Code - Preprocessor

For the sake of time and space code will be presented in stub form, thus it is not guaranteed to shown in complete form.

An example of stub code to be used is shown below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  //add this header

//some macro examples may seem contrived(deliberate)

#define PRINT_CHAR(letter) putchar(letter)
int main(void)
{

    char someLetter = 42;
    PRINT_CHAR(someLetter); //contrived macro use
/*
sometimes, it will be necessary for the students to use their imagination as to genuine implementations
*/

[...code...]

}
```

The **PREPROCESSOR** is a specialized text editor that provides certain language facilities \(such as text replacement and comment removal\)

A **PREPROCESSING DIRECTIVE** is any processor command, beginning with a hash symbol \(\#\), that provides a particular function.

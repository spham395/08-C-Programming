# C standard library functions

```c
void *malloc(size_t size);
/* malloc() allocates size bytes and returns a pointer
   to the allocated memory. The memory is not initialized. */

void free(void *ptr);
/* free() frees the memory space pointed to by ptr, which must
   have been returned by a previous call to malloc(), calloc() 
   or realloc(). */

void *calloc(size_t nmemb, size_t size);
/* calloc() allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of
   size bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
   The memory is set to zero. */

void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size);
/* realloc() changes the size of the memory block pointed to by
   ptr to size bytes. */
```
## POP QUIZ

1. Does free() delete your information?
2. Does realloc() always return a different memory address?
3. When realloc() returns a different memory address, is the original content…
    1. …Zeroized?
    2. …Freed?
4. Should we zeroize a pointer variable that’s been freed?

### DEMO LABS
    
## Demo functions

/demonstration_labs/functions.c
The purpose of this demo lab is to show off some functions that work on memory
DEFINITIONS: (You should always have the documentation up for functions you do not know/or remember how they work)
-strcpy(<char * destination>, <const char * source>)
    -Copies the C string pointed by <source> into the array pointed by <destination>, including the terminating null character
-strcmp(<const char * str1>, <const char * str2>)
    -This function starts comparing the first character of each string.
    If they are equal to each other, it continues with the following
    pairs until the characters differ or until a terminating null-character is reached.
-malloc(<size_t size>)
    -Allocates a block of <size> bytes of memory, returning a pointer to the beginning of the block.
-memmove( <void * destination>, <const void * source>, <size_t num> )
    -Copies the values of <num> bytes from the location pointed by <source> to the memory block pointed by <destination>.
    Copying takes place as if an intermediate buffer were used, allowing the destination and source to overlap.
-memcpy( <void * destination>, <const void * source>, <size_t num> )
    -Copies the values of <num> bytes from the location pointed
    to by <source> directly to the memory block pointed to by <destination>.
-strstr(const char * str1, const char * str2)
    -Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of str2 in str1, or a null pointer if str2 is not part of str1.

### Demo MALLOC_1
Follow the instructions below. This is a step by step guide.
USE THE MALLOC DOCUMENTATION!!!!!!!!!!!
Seriously... USE IT

```c
//TODO: Include needed headers
#include <stdio.h>          // For printf and such
#include <stdlib.h>         // For malloc()

int main(void)
{
    //TODO: Declare a integer pointer
    // This var will point to a memory allocation and will store data
    // ... into that allocated memory
    int *integer_ptr;

    /* TODO Using malloc()... allocate a section of memory the sizeof int
    Set this memory block to type int. Set your int pointer to this malloc
    --In short, this allocates a section of memory that is the size of
    an integer... AKA 4 bytes. We then tell it that we will be storing an
    integer type within it using (int *). Thus, we can store one integer within
    this allocated memory space. Finally we asign the value in integer_ptr to
    the memory address the malloc returned (aka the first address of the allocated space)
    */
    integer_ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int));


    // TODO: Ensure the pointer isn't NULL (Tell user there was an error and return if so)
    // If it's NULL, that means there wasn't enough space to allocate
    if (integer_ptr == 0)
    {
        printf("ERROR: Not enough memory!");
        return 1;
    }

    //TODO: Set the dereference of the int pointer to some integer value
    *integer_ptr = 20;

    //TODO: Print the dereferenced value of the integer pointer
    printf("The value is: %d\n", *integer_ptr);

    //TODO: Give back the memory space!!!!! This prevents buffer overflow and such
    free(integer_ptr);

    //TODO: NULL the pointer!!! This ensures we aren't pointing at garbage
    integer_ptr = NULL;

    return 0;
